Lite device tree of Samsung galaxy A52s 5G (SM-A528B), almost purely from this script: https://github.com/twrpdtgen/twrpdtgen and some small modifications.

THIS TREE REQUIRES FURTHER CONSOLIDATION/EXTRA MODIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE STABILITY AND AVOID ERORS.

Feel free to create a fork of this repository, which contains a better developed structure/content than of this tree.

Device.mk is named twrp.device.mk because once this tree is made stable and complete, the TWRP manifest requires the prefix to be added https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp.

Please ake a look at the heavy version: https://github.com/theyellowray/teamwinrecovery_samsung_a52sxq-heavy , which is more experimental.
